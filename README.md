# rosehack-restaurant-searching-app

Our project idea for RoseHack 2022 was to create a mobile app that allows the user to enter their address and choose from preset search radii centered on the address to search for nearby restaurants.
The user would be able to select various restaurant related tags to refine their restaurant searches such as Italian, Mexican and Japanese.

The user would also be able to view the restaurants' information such as what shows up when searching for a restaurant on Google.
Examples of things that would show up would be hours of operation, overall restaurant rating and address of the restaurant.
